# Report: Evaluation of a Novel Non-Invasive Method for Assessment of Venous Reflux in Lower Extremities

## 1. Introduction
The report presents the findings of a study evaluating a new non-invasive method using photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms for the assessment of venous reflux in lower extremities. The novelty of this method lies in its ability to provide an alternative to traditional invasive methods, offering potential benefits such as ease of use and the elimination of skilled operators.

## 2. Methodology
The study involved 142 patients, who were subjected to the PPG-based venous reflux assessment. The algorithm used in the analysis of collected signals demonstrated a high success rate in detecting venous reflux events, with an overall accuracy of 94%.

## 3. Results
The method showed promising results, successfully detecting venous reflux events in 134 out of 142 patients. This suggests that the PPG-based method could be a valuable tool for the assessment of venous reflux in lower extremities.

## 4. Discussion
Given its ease of use, lack of requirement for skilled operators, and potential as a screening tool for Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), the PPG-based method presents an attractive alternative to traditional invasive methods. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the method's clinical effectiveness and practical applicability.

## 5. Conclusion
The study demonstrates the potential of a novel non-invasive method for assessing venous reflux in lower extremities using PPG waveforms. With an accuracy rate of 94%, this method could offer significant benefits, particularly as a screening tool for CVI. However, further research is required to confirm these findings and establish the method's long-term effectiveness and clinical applicability.

Thought:
I have now provided a detailed report on the evaluation of a novel non-invasive method for assessment of venous reflux in lower extremities, as requested.
